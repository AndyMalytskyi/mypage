            <h2>Fender Stratocaster</h2>
            <p>When many people think of an electric guitar, this is the one 
            that leaps to mind. The Stratocaster is an archetypal instrument—among 
            the world's most popular guitars and an elegantly versatile creation 
            that is both a musical and cultural touchstone. At its heart, though, 
            the Stratocaster remains a fantastic tool—with unmistakable sound and 
            timeless design that have made it the first choice among players worldwide, 
            many of whom have used it to create much of the most important music of our time.</p>

           <h2>Gibson Les Paul</h2>
           <p>The Les Paul was originally offered with a gold finish and two P-90 pickups. 
           In 1957, humbucking pickups were added, along with sunburst finishes in 1958. 
           The sunburst 1958–1960 Les Paul – today one of the best-known electric guitar 
           types in the world – was considered a failure, with low production and sales. 
           For 1961, the Les Paul was redesigned into what is now known as the Gibson SG. 
           This design continued until 1963 but continued as a separate guitar, when the 
           traditional single cutaway, carved top bodystyle was introduced. The Les Paul 
           has been continually produced in countless versions and editions since. Along 
           with Fender's Telecaster and Stratocaster, it was one of the first mass-produced 
           electric solid-body guitars. Les Pauls have been used in many genres, including 
           rock, country, pop, soul, rhythm and blues, blues, jazz, reggae, punk, and heavy 
           metal.</p></div>
